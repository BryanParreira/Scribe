/// every suggestion, and on slow hardware it lets keystrokes pile doomed generations onto a model
/// that cannot keep up (each cancel still costs a decode setup and teardown). Keying the debounce
/// to the most recent generation latency makes fast machines snappier and slow machines calmer,
/// with no configuration. The configured value remains the fallback until a first latency exists.
